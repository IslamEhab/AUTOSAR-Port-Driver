In AUTOSAR, ordinary GPIO Driver is divided into 2 drivers:
- ** Dio Driver ** which responsible of writing/reading digital 0 or 1.
- ** Port Driver ** which responsible of setting all HW pins configurations (General Purpose DIO or alternative function, Analog or digital, input or output, etc.)

From the picture you can relate that Port & Dio are HW dependant, so that for every HW you need to build a new Dio & Port drivers

This projects implements Port Driver for TM4C123GH6PM

** At the end of development, there will be a PDF generated by doxygen that describes the Port & Dio drivers components like: **
- Structures & Enums used in the code
- API names and its parameters
- How to use these APIs, structures and enums
